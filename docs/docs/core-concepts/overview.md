### What is TruStacks?

TruStacks is a software delivery engine that enables teams to code with "ultra standardized", framework driven developer workflows.

### Why Make Something New?

TruStacks was created out of a need to adopt modern software delivery with minimal effort.

[Value Stream Delivery Platforms](https://devops.com/why-you-need-a-value-stream-delivery-platform/) stop short of the pipeline. TruStacks is the write once, consume anywhere approach to software delivery pipelines and developer workflows.

#### The Community

Solving software delivery is a massive undertaking. Rather than working in a silo, TruStacks is built in the open for the benefit of the software development community and industry as a whole.
