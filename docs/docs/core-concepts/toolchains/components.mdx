# Components

Components are the software tools that are deployed in the toolchain that enable software delivery.

## Types of Components

Toolchains contain two types of Components.

- Core Components 
- Supplemental Components

### Core Components

Every toolchain includes core components that provide the following capabilities:

- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- CI/CD

#### Single Sign-On

SSO provides seamless access to toolchain components.

All components that allow authenticated access from a user interface must support the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) (OIDC) protocol.

The **SSO component** is installed in the toolchain to issue OIDC client ids and secrets to peer components.

:::info saml support

SAML is not currently supported, but it may be added in the future.

:::

#### CI/CD Execution

Continous integration and deployment is the primary function of the toolchain and its related components.

The **CI/CD** component is installed in the toolchain to orchestrate the deployment of pipeline resources and excuction of CI/CD tasks.

### Supplemental Components

In addition to the core components, supplemental components provide extended capabilities for CI/CD tasks such as:

- code quality scanning
- gitops deployments
- regulatory compliance reporting

## Orchestration

Components in the TruStacks eco-system must be orchestrated for consumption without human intervention.

TruStacks orchestration works as follows:

  sources={{

    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/orchestration-dark.png'),
  }}
/>


### Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is used to deploy toolchain components.

All toolchain components originate from a base helm chart deployment. [Helm hooks](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/) are used to automatically provision components.

:::info what about operators?

Currently, helm has the best adoption. Operators may be supported in the future.

#### Values Templates

Component helm chart values are generated using values file templates.

The following is a sample `values` template from a [component configuration](https://github.com/TruStacks/catalog/blob/main/pkg/components/authentik/config.yaml). 

```yaml
{{- $postgresqlPassword := randAlphaNum 32 -}}
authentik:
  secret_key: {{ randAlphaNum 32 }}
  postgresql:
    host: authentik-postgresql
    password: {{ $postgresqlPassword }}
ingress:
  enabled: true
  hosts:
  - host: authentik.{{ .domain }}
  paths:
  - path: "/"
    pathType: "Prefix"
postgresql:
  enabled: true
  postgresqlPassword: {{ $postgresqlPassword }}
  fullnameOverride: authentik-postgresql
redis:
  enabled: true
envValueFrom:
  AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: authentik-bootstrap
      key: api-token
```

The values template uses the same [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) template functions as helm.

The above example requires the `domain` parameter to be defined in order to render the template. The parameters are set in the toolchain configuration and passed to the values template during the [toolchain installation](/tutorial/install-toolchain#configuration).

:::tip 

The parameters that can be consumed by values templates are defined in the [catalog config](https://github.com/TruStacks/catalog/blob/main/pkg/catalog/catalog.yaml) referenced in the toolchain dependencies.

### Hooks

TruStacks components perform provisioning tasks during different phases of the helm installation process.

The tasks executed in the hook are provided by the catalog container image running in [`hook mode`](https://github.com/TruStacks/catalog#hook). The component hooks are fully self-contained without any intervention or extra logic provided by the toolchain or engine. 

**pre-install**:
- create oidc clients and secrets
- create secrets needed by the component before release

**post-install**:
- configure service accounts, user groups and rbac roles
- create system inputs

:::info

This list is not comprehensive. There are an unlimited number of tasks that can be preferred in hooks.
